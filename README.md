# rosey-the-bot
The purpose of this bot was to search music subreddits for any shared songs and find the same song on all other streaming platforms.

After commenting on each post it will add the id of the post to *post_replied_to.txt* so it knows to not post on that submission again.

**Config.py** contains the private keys for the different API services.
